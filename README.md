# Angular Coding Example

## Using Angular to Fetch and Display Data
This project is intended to demonstrate some *basic* Angular chops.  :)

### Description
This code posts to an API (*https://www.swishersolutions.com/demos/api/api.php*) to receive a list of images, and then displays them in a responsive Angular grid.
- There are two image sets that can be toggled, one of the author and one of superheroes.
- The grid layout can be toggled between **3** and **4** columns. 
- Each card has a ***View*** button to open the image in a new window. 
- The cards are draggable... just for fun!

If you want to download this code and get it up and running in your own environment, you'll need to install a few things. Here are the commands to intall them *(Handy, amirite?)*:
- ng add @angular/material
